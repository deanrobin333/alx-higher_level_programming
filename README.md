## Background Context

### Welcome to the AirBnB clone project!

#### First step: Write a command interpreter to manage your AirBnB objects.

- This is the first step towards building your first full web application: the **AirBnB clone**. This first step is very important because you will use what you build during this project with all other following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integration…

- Each task is linked and will help you to:

	- put in place a parent class (called `BaseModel`) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of your future instances
	- create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance &lt;-&gt; Dictionary &lt;-&gt; JSON string &lt;-&gt; file
	- create all classes used for AirBnB (`User`, `State`, `City`, `Place`…) that inherit from `BaseModel`
	- create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.
	- create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine

### What’s a command interpreter?

- Do you remember the Shell? It’s exactly the same but limited to a specific use-case. In our case, we want to be able to manage the objects of our project:

	- Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
	- Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
	- Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
	- Update attributes of an object
	- Destroy an object
